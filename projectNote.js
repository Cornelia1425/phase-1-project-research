// 8 when click one of the all displayed data, reset the search bar to placeHolder

// 9 >> done,  when click new search, reset the search result instead of adding to it


/* note from cash:
0. you don't want to scroll down to see info

1. add loading animation, before fetch/when fetching, show certain animation, when 
fetched data, show the information

2. create json, grabbing multiple times from API, now it only 100, it has way more item, don't rely on the website, grab multipletimes and create your own json data

3. toggle light and dark mode, using State?

4. separate music and animation?? maybe i don't to do that. leave it for now.

5. CSS, make clickable buttons more obvious, hover over
